Scratch(Pi 5 & earlier)
====================================

Scratch is a graphical programming tool developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with the aim of helping people learn programming concepts, foster creativity, and develop problem-solving skills. It features a simple and intuitive drag-and-drop interface, enabling even beginners to easily create animations, games, and interactive media projects. Scratch also offers a rich library of resources, including characters, backgrounds, sounds, and graphics, which users can freely use in their projects, stimulating their creativity and imagination. Additionally, Scratch's online community provides a platform for users to share their projects, get inspired, and exchange learning experiences, making programming learning more engaging and interactive. Due to its ease of use and wealth of educational resources, Scratch has become a widely used tool in schools and educational institutions, providing students with a fun and challenging way to explore the world of programming.
