# Quick Guide on Scratch

## Install Scratch 3

When installing Raspberry Pi OS ([Installing the OS (Common)](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/davinci-kit/en/latest/preparation/installing_the_os.html#install-os)), you have to choose the version with desktop, either with desktop only or with desktop and recommended software.

If you install the version with the recommended software, you can see Scratch 3 in the system menu at **Programming**.

If you installed the desktop-only version, you will need to install Scratch 3 manually, as described below.







## About Scratch 3â€™s Interface

Scratch 3 is designed to be fun, educational, and easy to learn. It has tools for creating interactive stories, games, art, simulations, and more, using block-based programming. Scratch also has its own paint editor and sound editor built-in.

The top of scratch 3 has some basic options, the first one from left to right is the language option, you can choose different languages for programming. The second one is the **File** option, you can create new files, read local files and save current files with this option. The third is the **Edit** option, which allows you to resume some deletion operations and enable the acceleration mode (in which the sprite movement becomes particularly fast). The fourth is the **Tutorials** option, which allows you to view tutorials for some projects. The fifth is the file naming option, where you can rename the project.
